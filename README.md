# questionmark
Javascript website for a fictitious band.
Live website: http://mason.gmu.edu/~jargote/IT331/index.html

This project was built as a fictitious band site called Questionmark. This was a school project where I first learned javascript. Javascript is written throughout the website and I outline these functionalities below.

The index page consists of the following:
  - Buttons to increase/decrease font size on page
  - A button that opens lyrics in a pop-up window

The Events page consists of the following:
  - An animated image which can be stopped by pressing a button
  - A calendar in which a date can be chosen and the chosen date will appear right above the calendar
  - An events table in which the table headers are clickable to adjust sorting

The Members page consists of the following:
  - Band member images in which hovering over will display a tooltip

The Music page consists of the following:
  - CD release covers (images) in which hovering over will display information in the section directly below

The Guestbook page consists of the following:
  - A form which is validated prior to submission
